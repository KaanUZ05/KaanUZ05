## Hi there, I'm Kaan 👋 

I'm currently studying in Bilkent University Computer Science department. I am a second grader.

I am a Sophomore CS student passionate about building efficient software and understanding hardware logic. My focus ranges from **Object-Oriented Programming** to **Digital Design on FPGA**.
While I have gained a solid understanding of computer architecture and digital design through my coursework, my primary passion and career goal lie in building **software solutions**, exploring modern web technologies, and designing games.

### 🔭 Projects
- **Forgotten Shores (2D Survival Game):** A 2D single-player survival game built with **Java Swing & AWT** as a group project of CS102. Features a dynamic environment, grid-based crafting system, and hunger/thirst mechanics.
- **Monopoly Game (Java & OOP):** A comprehensive simulation of the classic board game. I implemented complex OOP principles like Inheritance and Polymorphism to manage game states and player interactions (CS102 Lab Work).
- **Yerime-Gez (Web Prototype):** Exploring full-stack development by prototyping a travel planning app with **Next.js** and **PostgreSQL**, leveraging AI tools to accelerate the workflow.
- **Smart Parking System (Hardware):** Designed a digital control system using **SystemVerilog** on FPGA. *This project demonstrates my ability to work with low-level logic, although my main focus is high-level software.*
